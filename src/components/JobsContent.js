            <p><strong>Analytic Postdoctoral Fellow at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY</strong></p>
            <p>A post-doctoral position is available in the lab of Dr. Inga Peter in the Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences to apply genetic, genomic, and systems biology approaches in order to identify biological pathways involved in cardiometabolic complications that arise in response to antiretrovital therapy (ART) in individuals living with HIV and compare them to the pathways leading to cardiometabolic risks in individuals with no HIV. The project combines minimum molecular genetics and mostly statistical and computational approaches to identify the genes and networks associated with cardiovascular risks and response to ART.</p>
            <p>We are seeking a highly motivated postdoctoral fellow to apply a variety of approaches to effectively integrate and analyze genetic, genomic, and clinical data to identify biological pathways that lead to premature cardiometabolic complications in individuals living with HIV and compare them to the pathways involved in cardiometabolic risks in individuals with no HIV. The successful candidate will apply independent problem solving requiring the use of existing and emerging scientific and statistical knowledge.</p>
            <p>Candidates should have strong expertise with statistical genetics and bioinfomatics (R, SAS, Perl/Python, PLINK, other statistical genetics packages) and a PhD in one of the following disciplines: Genetics, Genetic Epidemiology, Statistical Genetics, Bioinformatics, or Computational Biology. Prior experience in the field of genetics of cardiovascular disease is an advantage.</p>
            <p>Qualified candidates should possess strong communication skills, creativity, self-motivation, and the ability to work independently. Candidates must also be proficient in oral and written English.</p>
            <p>To apply, please submit: 1. A complete CV, including a list of publications. 2. A one-page statement of how your training and expertise connects to our research interests. 3. Contact information for at least 3 references to <a href="mailto:inga.peter@mssm.edu">inga.peter@mssm.edu</a></p>
