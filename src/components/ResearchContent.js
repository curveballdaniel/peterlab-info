                    <p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves chronic inflammation of all or part of the digestive tract. IBD primarily includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Familial aggregation and higher concordance rates in monozygotic than dizygotic twins have provided robust evidence for the involvement of genetic factors in the disease etiology. An important epidemiological feature of IBD is that it occurs at significantly different frequencies in different ethnic, demographic and racial groups, and has the highest prevalence among individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent.</p>

                    <p>We are taking advantage of an ongoing recruitment and the world class Division of Gastroenterology at Mount Sinai to conduct genetic, genomic, microbiome, systems biology and functional studies of IBD with the focus on the Ashkenazi Jewish population. We are particularly interested in large families with multiple affected individuals. Our goal is to detect genetic mutations that significantly contribute to the development of IBD and functionally validate them. This knowledge of the genetic risk may help identify individuals at high risk of developing the disease and discover new pharmaceutical targets to prevent, postpone and/or treat IBD.</p>

                    <p>IBD affects women during their reproductive years and 25% become pregnant after an initial diagnosis. Accumulating evidence suggests that newborn babies are not microbe-free and the types of bacteria found in their first stool, also known as meconium, have been linked to maternal diseases, including diabetes and eczema. The source of these microbes is of continued interest, because the initial colonization of bacteria is believed to play a crucial role in the development of the infant’s immune system and consequently the protection against the risk of diseases later in life.

Moreover, the goal is to explore the role of genetic make-up, disease activity throughout pregnancy, medications and clinical features on the bacterial composition of the baby. In addition, we will assess if feeding behavior (breastfeeding versus formula) and/or antibiotic use early in life help modify the microbiome. Given that the maternal gut bacteria can be manipulated by diet, food supplementation, and other ways, our study can help identify the types of bacteria that need to be altered prior or during pregnancy to significantly reduce the IBD risk transmission.</p>

                    <p>Craniosynostosis is a common malformation occurring in <strong>~4 per 10,000 live births</strong> in which the sutures close too early, causing long-term complications for normal brain and skull growth. Most often, craniosynostosis appears as an isolated, nonsyndromic, anomaly. Unilateral or bilateral fusion of the coronal suture accounts for 20–30% of all nonsyndromic craniosynostosis&nbsp;cases. The etiology of nonsyndromic&nbsp;<em>coronal</em> craniosynostosis&nbsp;is not well understood, although the published literature suggests that it is a multifactorial condition. About 5–14% of coronal craniosynostosis patients have a positive family history, with a specific genetic etiology identified in &gt;25% of nonsyndromic&nbsp;<em>coronal</em> craniosynostosis cases. Yet, the other causes for nonsyndromic craniosynostosis&nbsp;and its phenotypic heterogeneity remain largely unknown.</p>
