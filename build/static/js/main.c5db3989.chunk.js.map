Most often, craniosynostosis appears as an isolated, nonsyndromic, anomaly. Unilateral or bilateral fusion of the coronal suture accounts for 20–30% of all nonsyndromic craniosynostosis&nbsp;cases. The etiology of nonsyndromic&nbsp;<em>coronal</em> craniosynostosis&nbsp;is not well understood, although the published literature suggests that it is a multifactorial condition. About 5–14% of coronal craniosynostosis patients have a positive family history, with a specific genetic etiology identified in &gt;25% of nonsyndromic&nbsp;<em>coronal</em> craniosynostosis cases. Yet, the other causes for nonsyndromic craniosynostosis&nbsp;and its phenotypic heterogeneity remain largely unknown.</p>\r\n                  </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className=\"col-lg-4\">\r\n                  <div className=\"about-text\">\r\n                    <img\r\n                      src={window.location.origin + \"/images/craniosynostosis-image-2.jpg\"}\r\n                      alt=\"IBD-triggers\"\r\n                      style={{\"maxWidth\": \"100%\"}}\r\n                    />\r\n                    <div className=\"center-external-link\">\r\n                      <p><a href=\"http://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/peterlab/craniosynostosis-network/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">More on Craniosynostosis</a></p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                  </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className=\"col-lg-4\">\r\n                  <div className=\"about-text\">\r\n                    <p>In the first and only <a title=\"Genome-wide association study of NSC\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23160099\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">genome-wide association study of nonsyndromic craniosynostosis</a>&nbsp;our group identified two regions, downstream of <em>BMP2 </em>gene&nbsp;and within <em>BBS9</em>&nbsp;gene, associated with a 4-5 fold increased risk of <em>sagittal </em>nonsyndromic craniosynostosis.

Both estrogens and smoking, with known anti-estrogenic effects, alter the atherogenic lipid profile. We tested for a role of interaction between smoking and estrogen receptor alpha gene (ESR1) variation in association with plasma concentration of atherogenic small LDL particles and LDL particle size. We studied 1727 unrelated subjects, 854 women and 873 men, mean age 51 years (SD 10), from the population-based Framingham Heart Study. After covariate adjustment, women who smoked and had the common ESR1 c.454-397 TT genotype (in 30% of women, T was present on both chromosomes at position 397 prior to the start of exon 2) had >1.7-fold higher levels of small LDL particles than women with the alternative genotypes (P-value for smoking-genotype interaction was 0.001). Similar results were obtained for three other ESR1 variants including c.454-351A > G, in the same linkage disequilibrium block. A similar substantial gender-specific result was also evident with a fifth variant, in a separate linkage disequilibrium block, in exon 4 (P = 0.003). Women who smoked and had specific, common ESR1 genotypes had a substantially higher plasma concentration of atherogenic small LDL particles. Significant results revealed a dose-dependent effect of smoking and were evident in both pre- and postmenopausal women. The reported association has the potential to explain the risks associated with estrogen use in certain women and a recent report of association between an ESR1 haplotype comprised of c.454-397 T and c.454-351 A alleles with increased myocardial infarction and ischaemic heart disease, independent of the standard, established cardiovascular risk factors.\"\r\n        />\r\n\r\n        <Publication\r\n          date=\"3/19/07\"\r\n          link=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17372038\"\r\n          place=\"Hypertension\"\r\n          pmid=\"17372038\"\r\n          title=\"Age-related Changes in Echocardiographic Measurements: Association with Variation in the Estrogen Receptor-α Gene.\"\r\n          authors=\"Peter I, Huggins GS, Shearman AM, Pollak A, Schmid CH, Cupples LA, Demissie S, Patten RD, Karas RH, Housman DE, Mendelsohn ME, Vasan RS, Benjamin EJ.\"\r\n          extra=\"May;49(5):1000-6, 2007.\"\r\n          abstract=\"Left ventricular (LV) mass and other LV measures have been shown to be heritable. In this study we hypothesized that functional variation in the gene coding for estrogen receptor-alpha (ESR1), known for mediating the effect of estrogens on myocardium, is associated with age-related changes in LV structure. Four genetic markers (ESR1 TA repeat; rs2077647, or +30T>C; rs2234693, or PvuII; and rs9340799, or XbaI) were genotyped in 847 unrelated individuals (488 women) from the Framingham Offspring Study, who attended 2 examination cycles 16 years apart (mean ages at first examination: 43+/-9 years; at follow-up: 59+/-9 years). ANCOVA was used to assess the association of polymorphisms and their haplotypes with cross-sectional measurements and longitudinal changes in LV mass, wall thickness, end-diastolic and end-systolic internal diameter, and fractional shortening after adjustment for factors known to influence these variables. Changes over time were detected for all of the LV measurements (P ranging from <0.0001 to 0.02), except for fractional shortening in men. The SS genotype of the ESR1 TA repeat polymorphism in the promoter region was associated with longitudinal changes in LV mass and LV wall thickness (P ranging from 0.0006 to 0.01). Moreover, the TA[S]-+30[T]-PvuII[T]-XbaI[A] haplotype (frequency: 47.5%) was associated with greater LV changes as compared with the TA[L]-+30[C]-PvuII[C]-XbaI[G] haplotype (frequency: 31.8%). Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that common ESR1 polymorphisms are significantly associated with age-related changes in LV structure.

Seven genes revealed pleiotropy across three or more phenotypes, mostly related to lipid transport and metabolism.

There is a significant clinical variation among different sutural synostoses as well as significant variation within any given single-suture synostosis. Craniosynostosis can be isolated (i.e., nonsyndromic) or occurs as part of a genetic syndrome (e.g., Crouzon, Pfeiffer, Apert, Muenke, and Saethre-Chotzen syndromes). Approximately 85 % of all cases of craniosynostosis are nonsyndromic. Several recent genomic discoveries are elucidating the genetic basis for nonsyndromic cases and implicate the newly identified genes in signaling pathways previously found in syndromic craniosynostosis. Published epidemiologic and phenotypic studies clearly demonstrate that nonsyndromic craniosynostosis is a complex and heterogeneous condition supporting a strong genetic component accompanied by environmental factors that contribute to the pathogenetic network of this birth defect. Large population, rather than single-clinic or hospital-based studies is required with phenotypically homogeneous subsets of patients to further understand the complex genetic, maternal, environmental, and stochastic factors contributing to nonsyndromic craniosynostosis.

In this study, we investigated gene expression and allelic imbalance (AI) of NOD2 and ATG16L1 using common variants in human monocyte-derived DCs. Significant AI was observed in ~40% and ~70% of NOD2 and ATG16L1 heterozygotes, respectively (p<0.05). AI of NOD2 was inversely associated with its expression level (p=0.015). No correlation was detected between gene expression and AI for ATG16L1. When infected with Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV), NOD2 expression in DCs was induced about four-fold (p<0.001), whereas ATG16L1 expression was not affected (p=0.88). In addition, NDV infection tended to lower the variance in AI among DC populations for the NOD2 gene (p=0.05), but not the ATG16L1 gene (p=0.32). Findings of a simulation study, aimed to verify whether the observed variation in gene expression and AI is a result of sample-to-sample variability or experimental measurement error, suggested that NOD2 AI is likely to result from a deterministic event at a single cell level.

We date the split between the two ancestral populations to ≈ 12-25 Kyr, suggesting a predominantly Near Eastern source for the repopulation of Europe after the Last Glacial Maximum.\"\r\n        />\r\n\r\n        <Publication\r\n          date=\"9/1/2014\"\r\n          link=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24842889\"\r\n          place=\"Hum Mol Genet\"\r\n          pmid=\"24842889\"\r\n          title=\"Genome-wide mapping of IBD segments in an Ashkenazi PD cohort identifies associated haplotypes.\"\r\n          authors=\"Vacic V, Ozelius LJ, Clark LN, Bar-Shira A, Gana-Weisz M, Gurevich T, Gusev A, Kedmi M, Kenny EE, Liu X, Mejia-Santana H, Mirelman A, Raymond D, Saunders-Pullman R, Desnick RJ, Atzmon G, Burns ER, Ostrer H, Hakonarson H, Bergman A, Barzilai N, Darvasi A, Peter I, Guha S, Lencz T, Giladi N, Marder K, Pe&#8217;er I, Bressman SB, Orr-Urtreger A.\"\r\n          extra=\". 2014 Sep 1;23(17):4693-702\"\r\n          abstract=\"The recent series of large genome-wide association studies in European and Japanese cohorts established that Parkinson disease (PD) has a substantial genetic component. To further investigate the genetic landscape of PD, we performed a genome-wide scan in the largest to date Ashkenazi Jewish cohort of 1130 Parkinson patients and 2611 pooled controls. Motivated by the reduced disease allele heterogeneity and a high degree of identical-by-descent (IBD) haplotype sharing in this founder population, we conducted a haplotype association study based on mapping of shared IBD segments. We observed significant haplotype association signals at three previously implicated Parkinson loci: LRRK2 (OR = 12.05, P = 1.23 × 10(-56)), MAPT (OR = 0.62, P = 1.78 × 10(-11)) and GBA (multiple distinct haplotypes, OR > 8.28, P = 1.13 × 10(-11) and OR = 2.50, P = 1.22 × 10(-9)). In addition, we identified a novel association signal on chr2q14.3 coming from a rare haplotype (OR = 22.58, P = 1.21 × 10(-10)) and replicated it in a secondary cohort of 306 Ashkenazi PD cases and 2583 controls. Our results highlight the power of our haplotype association method, particularly useful in studies of founder populations, and reaffirm the benefits of studying complex diseases in Ashkenazi Jewish cohorts.\"\r\n        />\r\n\r\n        <h3 id=\"other-topics\" className=\"slight-title-padding\">Other topics</h3>\r\n\r\n        <Publication\r\n          date=\"9/17/08\"\r\n          link=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18382362\"\r\n          place=\"Diag Mol Pathol\"\r\n          pmid=\"18382362\"\r\n          title=\"Cell free DNA fragmentation patterns in amniotic fluid identify genetic abnormalities and changes due to storage.\"\r\n          authors=\"Peter I, Tighiouart H, Lapaire O, Johnson KL, Bianchi DW, Terrin N.\"\r\n          extra=\". 2008 Sep;17(3):185-90.\"\r\n          abstract=\"Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has become a promising biomarker in prenatal diagnosis. However, despite extensive studies in different body fluids, cfDNA predictive value is uncertain owing to the confounding factors that can affect its levels, such as gestational age, maternal weight, smoking status, and medications. Residual fresh and archived amniotic fluid (AF) supernatants were obtained from gravid women (mean gestational age 17 wk) carrying euploid (N=36) and aneuploid (N=29) fetuses, to characterize cfDNA-fragmentation patterns with regard to aneuploidy and storage time (-80 degrees C). AF cfDNA was characterized by the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction amplification of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, gel electrophoresis, and pattern recognition of the DNA fragmentation. The distributions of cfDNA fragment lengths were compared using 6 measures that defined the locations and slopes for the first and last peaks, after elimination of the confounding variables. This method allowed for the unique classification of euploid and aneuploid cfDNA samples in AF, which had been matched for storage time. In addition, we showed that archived euploid AF samples gradually lose long cfDNA fragments: this loss accurately distinguishes them from the fresh samples. We present preliminary data using cfDNA-fragmentation patterns, to uniquely distinguish between AF samples of pregnant women with regard to aneuploidy and storage time, independent of gestational age and initial DNA amount. In addition to potential applications in prenatal diagnosis, these data suggest that archived AF samples consist of large amounts of short cfDNA fragments, which are undetectable using standard real-time polymerase chain reaction amplification.\"\r\n        />\r\n\r\n        <Publication\r\n          date=\"3/28/08\"\r\n          link=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18260159\"\r\n          place=\"Prenat Diagn\"\r\n          pmid=\"18260159\"\r\n          title=\"Smoking in pregnancy is associated with increased total maternal serum cell-free DNA levels.\"\r\n          authors=\"Urato AC, Peter I, Canick J, Lambert-Messerlian G, Pulkkinen A, Knight G, Jeong YJ, Johnson KL, Bianchi DW.\"\r\n          extra=\"; Mar;28(3):186-90, 2008.\"\r\n          abstract=\"\"\r\n          objectives=\"Cell-free DNA is a marker of cellular apoptosis and necrosis.

In contrast, retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is caused by >50 known genes, which still explain only half of the clinical cases. In a single, one-generation, nonsyndromic RP family, we have identified a gene, dehydrodolichol diphosphate synthase (DHDDS), demonstrating the power of combining whole-exome sequencing with rapid in vivo studies. DHDDS is a highly conserved essential enzyme for dolichol synthesis, permitting global N-linked glycosylation. Zebrafish studies showed virtually identical photoreceptor defects as observed with N-linked glycosylation-interfering mutations in the light-sensing protein rhodopsin. The identified Lys42Glu variant likely arose from an ancestral founder, because eight of the nine identified alleles in 27,174 control chromosomes were of confirmed Ashkenazi Jewish ethnicity. These findings demonstrate the power of exome sequencing linked to functional studies when faced with challenging study designs and, importantly, link RP to the pathways of N-linked glycosylation, which promise new avenues for therapeutic interventions.\"\r\n        />\r\n\r\n        <Publication\r\n          date=\"12/6/2011\"\r\n          link=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21906714\"\r\n          place=\"Am J Ophthalmol\"\r\n          pmid=\"21906714\"\r\n          title=\"Evaluation of New and Established AMD Susceptibility Genes in the Women’s Health Initiative Sight Exam (WHI-SE) Study.\"\r\n          authors=\"Peter I, Huggins GS, Ordovas JM, Haan M, Seddon JM.\"\r\n          extra=\", 2011 Dec;152(6):1005-1013.\"\r\n          abstract=\"\"\r\n          purpose=\"To assess whether established and newly reported genetic variants, independent of known lifestyle factors, are associated with the risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) among women participating in the Women's Health Initiative Sight Exam (WHI-SE) Genetic Ancillary Study.\"\r\n          design=\"Multicenter case-control study.\"\r\n          methods=\"One hundred and forty-six women with intermediate and late stages of AMD and 1269 subjects without AMD underwent ocular examinations and fundus photography to determine stage of AMD.
