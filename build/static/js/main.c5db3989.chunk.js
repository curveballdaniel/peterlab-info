Both estrogens and smoking, with known anti-estrogenic effects, alter the atherogenic lipid profile. We tested for a role of interaction between smoking and estrogen receptor alpha gene (ESR1) variation in association with plasma concentration of atherogenic small LDL particles and LDL particle size. We studied 1727 unrelated subjects, 854 women and 873 men, mean age 51 years (SD 10), from the population-based Framingham Heart Study. After covariate adjustment, women who smoked and had the common ESR1 c.454-397 TT genotype (in 30% of women, T was present on both chromosomes at position 397 prior to the start of exon 2) had >1.7-fold higher levels of small LDL particles than women with the alternative genotypes (P-value for smoking-genotype interaction was 0.001). Similar results were obtained for three other ESR1 variants including c.454-351A > G, in the same linkage disequilibrium block. A similar substantial gender-specific result was also evident with a fifth variant, in a separate linkage disequilibrium block, in exon 4 (P = 0.003). Women who smoked and had specific, common ESR1 genotypes had a substantially higher plasma concentration of atherogenic small LDL particles. Significant results revealed a dose-dependent effect of smoking and were evident in both pre- and postmenopausal women. The reported association has the potential to explain the risks associated with estrogen use in certain women and a recent report of association between an ESR1 haplotype comprised of c.454-397 T and c.454-351 A alleles with increased myocardial infarction and ischaemic heart disease, independent of the standard, established cardiovascular risk factors."}),i.a.createElement(I,{date:"3/19/07",link:"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17372038",place:"Hypertension",pmid:"17372038",title:"Age-related Changes in Echocardiographic Measurements: Association with Variation in the Estrogen Receptor-\u03b1 Gene.",authors:"Peter I, Huggins GS, Shearman AM, Pollak A, Schmid CH, Cupples LA, Demissie S, Patten RD, Karas RH, Housman DE, Mendelsohn ME, Vasan RS, Benjamin EJ.",extra:"May;49(5):1000-6, 2007.",abstract:"Left ventricular (LV) mass and other LV measures have been shown to be heritable.

In contrast, retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is caused by >50 known genes, which still explain only half of the clinical cases. In a single, one-generation, nonsyndromic RP family, we have identified a gene, dehydrodolichol diphosphate synthase (DHDDS), demonstrating the power of combining whole-exome sequencing with rapid in vivo studies. DHDDS is a highly conserved essential enzyme for dolichol synthesis, permitting global N-linked glycosylation. Zebrafish studies showed virtually identical photoreceptor defects as observed with N-linked glycosylation-interfering mutations in the light-sensing protein rhodopsin. The identified Lys42Glu variant likely arose from an ancestral founder, because eight of the nine identified alleles in 27,174 control chromosomes were of confirmed Ashkenazi Jewish ethnicity. These findings demonstrate the power of exome sequencing linked to functional studies when faced with challenging study designs and, importantly, link RP to the pathways of N-linked glycosylation, which promise new avenues for therapeutic interventions."}),i.a.createElement(I,{date:"12/6/2011",link:"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21906714",place:"Am J Ophthalmol",pmid:"21906714",title:"Evaluation of New and Established AMD Susceptibility Genes in the Women\u2019s Health Initiative Sight Exam (WHI-SE) Study.",authors:"Peter I, Huggins GS, Ordovas JM, Haan M, Seddon JM.",extra:", 2011 Dec;152(6):1005-1013.",abstract:"",purpose:"To assess whether established and newly reported genetic variants, independent of known lifestyle factors, are associated with the risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) among women participating in the Women's Health Initiative Sight Exam (WHI-SE) Genetic Ancillary Study.",design:"Multicenter case-control study.",methods:"One hundred and forty-six women with intermediate and late stages of AMD and 1269 subjects without AMD underwent ocular examinations and fundus photography to determine stage of AMD. Fourteen polymorphisms at or near 11 genes, including previously confirmed genes CFH, ARMS2/HTRA1, C2, C3, and CFI; recently reported AMD genes in the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) pathway LIPC, ABCA1, CETP, and LPL; TIMP3/SYN3, a known ocular gene recently linked with AMD; and APOE, were assessed using logistic regression analysis.",results:"After adjustment for demographic, behavioral, and other genetic factors, a protective effect was detected among TT carriers compared with non-carriers for the HDL pathway gene, LIPC rs493258, for intermediate and late AMD (OR [95% confidence interval]: 0.3 [0.2-0.7], P = .003). Variants in CFH rs1410996, ARMS2/HTRA1 A69S, and C3 R102G were significantly associated with an increased risk of AMD. Individuals with the homozygous CFI rs10033900 TT genotype had a 2.9 [1.2-7.2]-fold increased risk, and those with the CFH Y402H GG genotype had a 2.2 [1.0-4.8]-fold higher risk of developing AMD compared with non-carriers.
